littlex 🚀

littlex is a lightweight social-media–style application built using the Jac programming language and the Jaseci ecosystem. It demonstrates how graph-based programming can be used to model users, posts, and interactions naturally.

This project is designed for learning, experimentation, and submission purposes where Jac / Jaseci / byLLM compliance is required.

✨ Features

👤 User profiles modeled as graph nodes

📝 Posts and interactions represented as relationships (edges)

🔄 Walkers for traversing and manipulating the social graph

🧠 Clean example of Object-Spatial Programming (OSP) in Jac

⚡ Minimal, readable Jac code for beginners

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Jac (.jac)

Framework: Jaseci / Jac Runtime

Paradigm: Graph-based (nodes, edges, walkers)

🧠 Key Jac Concepts Used

Concept	Description

Node	Represents entities like users or posts
Edge	Represents relationships (follow, post, etc.)
Walker	Traverses and operates on the graph
Graph	The connected data model

🎯 Project Purpose

This project was built to:

Practice Jac language fundamentals

Demonstrate graph-based application design

Meet requirements where projects must be written in Jac / Jaseci / byLLM

Serve as a foundation for future enhancements



---

🚀 Future Improvements

Add authentication logic

Connect a frontend UI

Persist graph data

Integrate byLLM or OSP-based AI features
